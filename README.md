![Alt text](screenshots/symail.png?raw=true "Title")

SyPet synthesized around 80 methods for:
* Graphical user interface
* Testing network access
* File and string manipulation
* Encryption of emails and password
* Email functionalities
* Date/time manipulation

SyMail has around 2,000 LOC and 30% of them were automatically synthesized by 
SyPet! This significantly reduced the programming effort to build SyMail. Using 
program synthesizers as code assistants has the potential to revolutionize 
software development and significantly increase programmer productivity.
